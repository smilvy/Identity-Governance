# Deploy a Comprehensive Identity and Governance Management Solution for Scoop Mall Ltd

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a robust Identity and Governance Management Solution for **Scoop Mall Ltd**, an e-commerce company with both internal and external users. The primary goal is to secure Microsoft 365 operations by managing identity, access, and governance effectively, protecting the company from security threats, and ensuring that access privileges are well-regulated based on job roles.

## Key Objectives
1. **Identity Management**: Centralize identity management to provide Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and conditional access to secure internal and external user access.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement role-based access control for IT and other teams to ensure access is based on specific job roles.
3. **Threat Protection**: Safeguard the Microsoft 365 environment against spam, phishing attacks, and unsafe email attachments.
4. **Data Governance and Compliance**: Classify and protect sensitive information, maintain audit trails, and ensure compliance with company policies.

## Project Components

### 1. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
   - **Identity Provider**: Centrally manage identities for internal and external users.
   - **Access Management**: Enable SSO, MFA, and Conditional Access to secure access to resources.
   - **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**: Control access to privileged resources based on job roles, limiting access to sensitive information.

### 2. Microsoft 365 Security Tools
   - **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Protect against security threats like spam, phishing, and unsafe email attachments.
   - **Azure Information Protection (AIP)**: Classify and secure sensitive data in emails and documents, ensuring access only by authorized users.

### 3. Microsoft Compliance Center
   - **Audit and Monitoring**: Enable continuous monitoring of activities and user access.
   - **Reports and Alerts**: Set up reporting and alerting for potential security risks, policy violations, or unusual activities.

### 4. Integration with Microsoft 365 Tools (Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive)
   - **Exchange Online**: Set up secure, role-based email access.
   - **SharePoint Online**: Configure team-specific and role-based access to collaboration sites.
   - **OneDrive for Business**: Provide personal storage for each user with controlled access and sharing capabilities.

## Project Architecture

### Solution Architecture Diagram
Refer to the [Architecture Diagram](./architecture_diagram.png) for a visual representation of the solutionâ€™s components and data flow.

### Data Flow Overview
1. **User Authentication**: Azure AD manages all identity and access requests, enforcing MFA and Conditional Access policies.
2. **Role-Based Access**: Privileged access is restricted through PIM, ensuring only necessary personnel have access to high-security resources.
3. **Data Classification**: Azure Information Protection (AIP) labels data and restricts access as per sensitivity and compliance needs.
4. **Threat Protection**: Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides email protection by filtering spam and detecting phishing attempts.

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft 365 E5 License** for advanced security and compliance capabilities.
- **Azure AD Premium P2 License** for Privileged Identity Management and Conditional Access.
- **Admin Access** to Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Azure Portal.

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Azure AD Configuration
   - **Create Security Groups** for role-based access (e.g., Sales, HR).
   - **Configure Conditional Access Policies** to enforce MFA and secure access based on risk.
   - **Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** to manage privileged roles.

#### 2. Microsoft Defender for Office 365
   - Set up policies to filter out phishing emails, block unsafe attachments, and prevent spam.
   - Configure alerts for suspicious activity and configure anti-phishing policies for high-risk accounts.

#### 3. Azure Information Protection
   - Define classification labels (e.g., Confidential, Public) to protect sensitive data.
   - Configure policies for encryption, access restrictions, and data sharing.

#### 4. Integration with Microsoft 365 Tools
   - **Exchange Online**: Automatically assign email licenses and configure distribution lists based on role.
   - **SharePoint Online**: Assign group-based access to team sites, ensuring each department has access to necessary resources.
   - **OneDrive for Business**: Ensure each user has personal storage provisioned upon onboarding.

#### 5. Offboarding Process
   - Automate the offboarding process to remove access from Azure AD, SharePoint, Exchange, and OneDrive upon employee termination.
   - Set up workflows to transfer ownership of documents and files as needed.

### Automation
- **Power Automate**: Use Power Automate flows to streamline onboarding, offboarding, notifications, and data sharing between users.
- **Audit and Reporting Automation**: Set up automated governance reports and activity logs within the Microsoft Compliance Center.

## Governance and Compliance

### Access Review
Perform regular access reviews in Azure AD to ensure that permissions are aligned with job roles and are continuously updated.

### Monitoring and Auditing
Use the Microsoft Compliance Center to monitor user activity, access attempts, and data access, providing audit trails and reports for compliance.

### Incident Management
Set up alerts and notifications for suspicious activities and security incidents. Establish a response plan to address issues promptly.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against phishing, spam, and other security threats with comprehensive identity and access controls.
- **Streamlined Access Management**: Centralized, role-based access controls ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive resources.
- **Data Protection and Compliance**: Automated data classification and protection policies help safeguard sensitive information and maintain regulatory compliance.
- **Automated User Lifecycle Management**: Simplifies onboarding and offboarding, ensuring accurate and timely access provisioning and revocation.
